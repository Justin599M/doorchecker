# doorchecker
image processer checks to see if door is open or not for security when im not home
it works by starting on far right side of door and scanning to the left, if it detects change in color it will be marked as open
it also compares the surrounding area to the door as a double check and to establish confidence
NOTE: lefttoright class is misnames as program originally scanned from the left to right
